This application is a map of Boston that displays 20 popular places in the area.  It utilizes the Instagram API to get recent photos from these locations.  The photos can be viewed by clicking the button with the Instagram icon on it, located at the bottom of the page.

There is a search bar that can be used to filter the results by either name or type.  (Type being bar, restaurant, etc.).  Locations can be selected by clicking on the result in the list view or by clicking on a marker on the map.  Selecting a location will cause an infowindow (containing additional information about the place) to display above the map marker.
